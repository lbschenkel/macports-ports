This is [my](https://github.com/lbschenkel) personal fork of the
MacPorts ports tree.

I contribute to the project and I am the official maintainer of a few ports:

- argyll: <http://argyllcms.com>
- dict (+libmaa): <http://www.dict.org>
- free42: <http://thomasokken.com/free42>
- gpgme: <https://www.gnupg.org/software/gpgme>
- hunspell-dict-pt_BR: <https://pt-br.libreoffice.org/projetos/vero>
- hunspell-dict-sv_SE: <https://sfol.se>
- neomutt: <https://www.neomutt.org>
- ntpsec: <https://www.ntpsec.org>
- opensc: <https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki>
- p11-kit: <https://p11-glue.freedesktop.org/p11-kit.html>
- syncthing-0.14: <https://syncthing.net>
- usbids: <http://www.linux-usb.org/usb.ids>
- usbutils: <https://github.com/gregkh/usbutils>
- yubico-piv-tool: <https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-piv-tool>

Those are mostly software I use and either were not in MacPorts or did not
have a maintainer.

In case there's an issue with the above ports the usual way to report that
is by [creating a ticket](https://trac.macports.org/newticket) in the
MacPorts project tracker, but you can also
[create an issue](https://github.com/lbschenkel/macports-ports/issues)
directly on my repository.
